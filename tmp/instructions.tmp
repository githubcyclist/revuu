Make a block method that uses "yield" 

Write a block method, Array#each_odd, that returns in place a version of  
the array that replaces each element having an odd-numbered index (so,  
[1], [3], [5], etc.) with the result of passing that element to the block.

Apply the methods to 'az' and 'nums' (in the code starter) and display  
the output, which should be, precisely: 

["a", "B", "c", "D", "e", "F", "g"]
[1, 4, 3, 8, 5, 12, 7, 16, 9, 20]
