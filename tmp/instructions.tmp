Destructuring assignment 

Rewrite the following ES5 code using a "destructuring assignment"  
permitted by ES6. (Comment out the old-fashioned lines.) 

const Faves = { fruit: 'apple', music: 'Irish trad', prog_lang: 'Ruby' };
const fruit = Faves.fruit; 
const music = Faves.music;
const prog_lang = Faves.prog_lang;
